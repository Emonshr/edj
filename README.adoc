= edj

Edj (pronounced like the English word "edge") is the skeleton of a simple line editor patterned after Unix ed(1).

It was not created to be a useful editor, but to provide a home for some demonstrations of Design Patterns in
the Java language. If someone (or even me) tries to turn it into a useful line editor, you'll know that CLI fans
have regained the upper hand in geekdom. Or not.
